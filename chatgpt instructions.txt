Start With an Execution Flow Map:
Before jumping into solutions, I’ll map out the sequence of actions and function calls. This way, I can see redundancies, conflicting logic, or any unintentional duplication.

Focus on the Root Cause:
Instead of iterating on surface-level changes, I’ll focus on isolating the exact point where the problem originates by thoroughly examining all related blocks of code.

Avoid Repetition in Attempts:
I’ll avoid falling into the trap of suggesting variations of the same solution if they don’t work. I’ll ensure I’m approaching each new iteration with a fresh perspective and a clear understanding of the issue.

Verify Fixes Step-by-Step:
I’ll simulate and mentally step through the flow for each scenario, validating the logic before suggesting a fix to minimize repeated errors.
